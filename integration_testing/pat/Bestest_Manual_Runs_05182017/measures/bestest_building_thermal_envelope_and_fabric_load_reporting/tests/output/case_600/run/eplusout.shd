..In the following, only the first 10 reference surfaces will be shown.
..But all surfaces are used in the calculations.
==================================
Surface=ZONE SURFACE EAST is used as Receiving Surface in calculations and is convex.
Number of general casting surfaces=0

Number of receiving sub surfaces=0
==================================
Surface=ZONE SURFACE NORTH is used as Receiving Surface in calculations and is convex.
Number of general casting surfaces=0
Number of back surfaces=0
Number of receiving sub surfaces=0
==================================
Surface=ZONE SURFACE SOUTH is used as Receiving Surface in calculations and is convex.
Number of general casting surfaces=0
Number of back surfaces=5
...Surface=ZONE SURFACE EAST
...Surface=ZONE SURFACE NORTH
...Surface=ZONE SURFACE WEST
...Surface=ZONE SURFACE FLOOR
...Surface=ZONE SURFACE ROOF
